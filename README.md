# SumOfPowers
A python script to search for integer solutions to a^4+b^4+c^4+d^4=e^4

This is a Python version of a method by J. Leech to search for solutions to the sum of four 4th-powers being equal to another 4th power.

Leech J. On A^4 + B^4 + C^4 + D^4 = E^4. Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. 1958;54(4):554-555. doi:10.1017/S0305004100003091

another slightly larger solution to cross-verify is taken from:

Brudno S. A further example of A^4 + B^4 + C^4 + D^4 = E^4. Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. 1964;60(4):1027-1028. doi:10.1017/S0305004100038470

Interestingly, it seems that my python implementation is probably not faster than what they did in 1958 ;)
